# Data Stores

A data store is a collection of records.  In the App SDK stores are the standard data container for all UI components.  Stores support querying, filtering, sorting and paging data from Rally's Web Services API.

This exercise builds on the concepts from the [Data Models](../data-models) and [Context](../context) exercises to query for items from Rally's WSAPI.  The exercise also demonstrates event handling and some basic usage of the [Lo-Dash](http://help.rallydev.com/apps/2.1/doc/#!/guide/third_party_libs-section-lo-dash-2.4.1) library.
