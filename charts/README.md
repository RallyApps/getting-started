# Charts

Charts are a popular and convenient way to visualize data in Rally.  Unfortunately due to their complexity they are also one of the most difficult tasks perform when writing apps.

This exercise will demonstrate how to use the [Rally.ui.chart.Chart](http://help.rallydev.com/apps/2.1/doc/#!/api/Rally.ui.chart.Chart) component to build a basic chart showing portfolio item throughput by release.
