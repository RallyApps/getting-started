#Data Models

Models are the foundation upon which all data access is done in the App SDK.
A model is simply a client side representation of a server side data type.
For example, a user story model and its fields represent the HierarchicalRequirement type definition and its attributes on the server.

This exercise demonstrates the basic concepts of working with models:

* Obtain a model
* Create a record
* Read a record
* Update a record
* Delete a record
