# Context

Each app is instantiated with a [Rally.app.Context](http://help.rallydev.com/apps/2.1/doc/#!/api/Rally.app.Context) which describes the environment in which the app is currently running.  Information on the current project, workspace, subscription and user are all included.

This exercise will demonstrate how to add components to an app and will use these components to display some of the contents of the context object.  

Some helpful documentation:
